# estatelookout.ai

**Estate Lookout** is a customer-centric project designed to enhance user experience in the house hunting process. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools such as NLTK and SpaCy, along with other sklearn tools, users can freely describe their desired property features, and the search will be processed and filtered accordingly.
